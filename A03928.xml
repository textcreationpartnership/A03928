            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which noueltie pleaſed the father ſo well, as he would needes aske his pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, whither that were not far better, then the other faſhion of pronouncing them after the miniſter, hee reading the wordes, and directing the couples by them. So as if the obiection here
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4549:68"/>made haue ſtrength, it mightily ouermatcheth this practiſe of ſome one, who hath fellowſhippe in other points of oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our eccleſiaſticall canons and order. The <hi>reall</hi> anſwer to purpoſe was, and is thus. Firſt none could giue inſtance that any other did it but the miniſter, the reſt of the congregation pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that generall confeſſion, word for word after him. But if ſo it were (as the booke to their vnderſtanding pretends a libertie, yet no offence at all for any one of the congregation publickely to read an inditement drawne againſt his owne ſoule. For ſo that confeſſion is, wherein the people are deepely ingaged. Where it handling the kay of opening the kingdome of God by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie of his word, that the Rubricke ſhould ſay <hi>This ſentence of abſolution be pronounced by man or woman, or anie one of the Communicants,</hi> then were iuſt cauſe to be taken againſt it. But the truth is, the booke wiſely prouideth that the prieſt or Biſhop being preſent ſhall vpon confeſſion firſt made, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe to the people ſay &amp;c. Well knowne it is that in the vniuerſities, our colledges, &amp; ſchooles of learning appoint in time of diuine ſeruice, certaine choriſters or ſcholers to reade chap. ſay praiers, ſing the letanie, and ſuch like. All which ſo done by ſuch, is performed all that while by other then profeſſ miniſters, that haue taken orders. As for the inforced concluſion <hi>(That we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit weomen to ſpeake openlie)</hi> proueth no ſuch thing: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did it; No ſuch aduantage. For weomen are to ſpeake iointlie with the whole congregation whereof they are a part, or els how ſhall they ſing Pſalmes, and ſeueral alone by themſelues, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may bee offred, whither at the lauer of regeneration when they became ſureties and Godmothers for little ones then to be baptiſed, or to make anſwer at the ſolemnization of mariage, when as their huſbands for their part promiſe to take them to wiues, and they againe in like words ſay aſmuch on their owne behalfe audibly, and aloud, that the reſt of the congregation may witneſſe the publicke vow each of them make to one another. Wherefore it cannot bee thought ſcandalous if neede ſo require, that a confeſſion bee made in the name of all thoſe that receiue the holy communion, either by one of them (as this obiection wil needes haue it thought) man or woman, or elſe by any of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4549:73"/>this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuen by others, and will they not take reaſon at our handes. What is this but like wantons that will haue no bread at any ones hande, but ſuch a one, or ſuch a one they fancy; though it be deliuered them as kindelie, cut from the ſame loafe that others giue. But becauſe children make orts, and are ſicke of the wantons, they haue a rod otherwhiles and the bread taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and all little inough to bring downe their ſtout ſtomack glad afterwards to leape at a cruſt &amp; to prize husks &amp; hogs waſh as the vnthrift did, when he was in a ſtrange country: We néed not apply it, they are of vnderſtanding, whome wee make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto: God giue them as inward and inlie a feeling of that we know they well vnderſtand. This third interpretation wee adde from their mouth, whoſe preſence neare his highneſſe perſon may giue aſſurance of a truth. The word <hi>neceſſarie</hi> hath a twofold ſignification. One more large, the other more ſtrict. Large as that which is neceſſarie vpon ſuppoſition if it may wel bee, ſtrict without ſuppoſition as that if muſt needes bee what ere come of it.
